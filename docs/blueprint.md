# **App Name**: Code Clash

## Core Features:

- Challenge Prediction: Users can place 'bets' (predictions) on the outcome of coding challenges (e.g., whether a piece of code will compile, pass specific test cases, or meet certain performance criteria).
- Leaderboard: Display a leaderboard of users who have made correct predictions and earned points, fostering a sense of competition and community.
- AI powered assessment: A generative AI "tool" to create test cases, and predict whether user's solutions will pass the test cases. Uses these AI test case tools to assess correctness of the challenges for which users made a bet.
- Post-challenge analysis: The app can allow users to examine one anothers code after the betting is over, and challenges results are public.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of sophistication and intelligence, referencing the depth of coding knowledge.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA), a soft and desaturated hue, providing a gentle backdrop that complements the primary indigo without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), to create highlights and draw attention to key interactive elements and calls to action. Its higher brightness and saturation set it apart from the primary color.
- Clean and modern fonts with good readability for code snippets and UI elements.
- Simple and clear icons representing different coding languages, challenge types, and user actions.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and create a smooth user experience.
