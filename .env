# Genkit Google AI API Key
# For local development, you can put your key here.
# For production, set this as an environment variable in your hosting platform.
# DO NOT commit this file with your actual API key if it's not .gitignored.
# Consider creating a .env.local file (which is typically gitignored by default in Next.js projects)
# and putting your local development key there.
